# Breast-Cancer-Detection


## Project Overview

### Objective
To build a predictive model for detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques.

### Dataset
Utilized the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle, which includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

### Outcome
Achieved a high accuracy in classifying tumors as benign or malignant.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

### Feature Engineering
Normalized features and selected the most relevant ones for the model.

### Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Model Building

### Algorithms Used
Implemented various machine learning algorithms including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### Model Tuning
Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics
Assessed models using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Results and Findings

### Best Model
Identified the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### Feature Importance
Analyzed feature importance to understand the key contributors to the model's predictions.

### ROC Curve
Plotted ROC curves to visualize the performance of the models.

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Summary
Summarized the key findings and the overall performance of the best model.

### Improvements
Discussed potential improvements and future directions, such as using more advanced deep learning techniques or incorporating additional features.

### Deployment
Considered steps for deploying the model into a real-world application for early breast cancer detection.
